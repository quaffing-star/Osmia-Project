# Osmia Project
A standards‑driven, open ecosystem for the capture, analysis, amplification, synthesis, and encoding of natural scent.

---

## Overview

The Osmia Project defines a unified scientific and technical framework for working with natural scent as a reproducible, analyzable, and composable medium. It integrates advances in analytical chemistry, machine learning, synthetic chemistry, and open‑science infrastructure to create the first end‑to‑end pipeline for representing scent in a structured, interoperable form.

The project is organized around a central idea: natural scent can be captured, modeled, reconstructed, and encoded with the same rigor that other sensory domains—such as sound or light—have achieved through shared standards. Osmia provides the architectural foundation for this capability.

The full conceptual and scientific basis for the project is described in the **Founding Document**, located at:

## Core Components

- **Foundational Framework**  
  The scientific and conceptual grounding for the project, including the nature of scent, the technological convergence that enables Osmia, and the long‑term vision for an open olfactory ecosystem.

- **Standards and Data Formats**  
  Specifications for the `.osp` file format, metadata schemas, and contribution protocols that ensure interoperability across tools, datasets, and institutions.

- **Pipeline Architecture**  
  Modular components for capture, GC‑MS analysis, perceptual modeling, amplification, synthesis, and composition.

- **Modeling and Perception**  
  Machine‑learning models that map chemical structure and concentration to perceptual descriptors, intensity curves, and mixture interactions.

- **Ethical and Ecological Commitments**  
  Guidelines for non‑destructive sampling, conservation partnerships, data provenance, and responsible use.

## Project Scope

The Osmia Project supports scientific, technical, and creative work across several domains:

- **Analytical chemistry** — high‑fidelity capture and GC‑MS analysis of volatile mixtures  
- **Machine learning** — perceptual modeling, mixture prediction, and amplification  
- **Synthetic chemistry** — formulation, controlled release, and reconstruction  
- **Ecology and conservation** — non‑destructive sampling and environmental archiving  
- **Creative practice** — scent composition, multisensory design, and immersive media  
- **Information science** — molecular encoding, authentication, and data representation  

The project is open‑core: the standards, reference tools, and data formats are public goods, while commercial and institutional applications may be built on top of them.

## Contributing

The Osmia Project is an open, community‑governed initiative. Contributions are welcome from chemists, ML researchers, perfumers, ecologists, archivists, designers, and open‑science practitioners. Contribution guidelines, sampling protocols, and review processes will be published in the `/standards/` directory as they are formalized.
